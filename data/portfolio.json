        "To commemorate the Pulse Night Club shooting that took place in Orlando on June 12th, 2016, my graduate school program organized and put on a 4.9k commUNITY rainbow run.", "As a key member of the commUNITY rainbow team, I was tasked with the job of collaborating with the city to get our route approved as well as communicating with barricade companies and police departments. I also helped put flyers up all over the city of Orlando. Since I am very passionate about this race, I took on extra tasks such as bringing flyers for the virtual run aspect of our race (a way for people who are not in Orlando to participate and contribute to the cause) to places like New York. I went to restaurants and stores all over the city putting up our flyers.", "I also was responsible for reaching out to Walmart in hopes of an in-kind donation or a gift card to their store, which many of them were happy to give.", "Below are pictures documenting my work so far."
